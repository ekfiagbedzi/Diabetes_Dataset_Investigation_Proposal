# DIABETES PREDICTION (CAPSTONE PROPOSAL)

This project is a requirement to graduate from the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Programme offered by Udacity.

It includes a jupyter notebook named **diabetes_prediction_proposal.ipynb**, a pdf version of it named **proposal.pdf** and the diabetes dataset **diabetes.csv** to be used for the project.

The project gives the following;

* A background of the diabetes issue at hand.
* A problem statement.
* A brief description of the dataset including some sample code.
* A solution statement which clearly states what models would be trained.
* A Sample code for creating a dummy or baseline model to be use as a benchmark.
* The kind of evaluation metrics to be used to evaluate the model.
* How the model will be deployed.
* References.
* Acknowledgements.
